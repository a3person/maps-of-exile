While the room is green, zombies will continuously spawn - when slain these zombies inflict a stacking debuff causing you to deal less damage. While the room is purple, small purple areas spawn which deal Chaos DoT and slow your character. At any point during the fight you can pull the valve to removes all debuffs and ground effects - changing the room to the next colour but also giving Doedre a buff (depending on the colour).
