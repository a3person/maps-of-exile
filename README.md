# poe-tools

Shows and filters map/card/map metadata from various sources. None of these data are made up or manually inputted (by me).
There are still some subjective data coming from PoeDB or missing data, especially the **Boss** column showing boss
difficulty but that usually isn't the deciding factor.

## Sources of data

**Stacked Decks card spreadsheet** by **_üêå** from **Prohibited Library** discord:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/104ESCXdjVGBSF1BNbClfoilVEYC7pIHZxOSsb5W-_r4/edit

**Map metadata** from **PoeDB**:  
https://poedb.tw/us/Maps#MapsList  
https://poedb.tw/us/Colonnade_Map (example of single map)  

**Card prices** from **PoeNinja**:  
https://poe.ninja/challenge/divination-cards  
https://poe.ninja/api/data/itemoverview?league=Crucible&type=DivinationCard (api call)  

**Card drops** from **PoeWiki**:  
https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Colonnade_Map  

## TODO (maybe, if ever)

- Boss length (short/long bosses, for mapping, e.g bosses with phases are bad)
- Boss spawn (spawned in at start of map or not, for altars)
- Layouts good for league mechanics (legion/breach/stuff like that, mostly
    pretty open, even though this is already partially covered with outdoors
    tag)
